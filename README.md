# Battleship

This version of Battleship is a web-based app based on the popular children's board game. Play against your computer to try to find and sink its ships,  before it sinks all of yours! 

## Getting Started

Open up the game in your browser and click the "Reset" button to start the game. Enter your first shot coordinates into the target panel, and fire away! 

You can also select your shots by clicking directly into the Radar board. 

Mute the audio by toggling the button toward the botto of the app.
